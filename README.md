# Let's do something fun.

Implement one array method with test for it using Jest and send in a Pull Request.

This is to familiarize you with open source contribution, CI and of course Testing.

## Getting Started

- Read this [step by step guide](https://link.medium.com/7AjLJHdO02) to get your code into this repository

- Pick an array method, there is a list [here](https://javascript.info/array-methods) make sure no one has written it.

- Create a new file in the `src` directory `<METHOD_NAME>.js` e.g `map.js` make sure the method hasn't been written already.

- create a new file to write your tests `<METHOD_NAME>.test.js` e.g `map.test.js`

- I wrote `map.js` and `map.test.js` feel free to use it as a template

- Check [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the signature of the array method you have chosen to write

## Rules

1. You can’t reuse any array method in your implementation e.g forEach, map. Use `for`, `while`, `for-of`,... if you need to iterate.

2. In the **`__test__`** directory, create a new file <METHOD_NAME>.test.js, check `__test__/map.test.js` for a test sample to guide your implementation. You must write enough test for any array method you implement.

3. Add a link to your GitHub profile and the method you implemeted to the contributors section.

4. Your method should be prefixed with an \_ e.g
   `Array.prototype._map = function(){}`

5. You can't write a method that someone has previously written. Please check contributions section below to see all methods that have been implemented.
